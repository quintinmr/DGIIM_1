    		source file when debugging)
      -g	create global variables when used in a shell function; otherwise
    		ignored
      -p	display the attributes and value of each NAME
    
    Options which set attributes:
      -a	to make NAMEs indexed arrays (if supported)
      -A	to make NAMEs associative arrays (if supported)
      -i	to make NAMEs have the `integer' attribute
      -l	to convert the value of each NAME to lower case on assignment
      -n	make NAME a reference to the variable named by its value
      -r	to make NAMEs readonly
      -t	to make NAMEs have the `trace' attribute
      -u	to convert the value of each NAME to upper case on assignment
      -x	to make NAMEs export
